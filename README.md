# etch_a_sketch


Here is a web browser Etch-A-Sketch, where you begin by clicking the button at the top left of the page. 
The button will ask you to input a number less than 150 which will represent the number of squares per side,
making the grid yeah an area of (number * number), to fill up the view width and view height. 
150 is the limit, because any higher than that will cause some lag or delay.

There is a trail that follows the mouse cursor as it hovers over the web page. Re-clicking the button at the 
top left will reset the grid with a blank white. You can also change the number if you would like a more
pixelated experience. Enjoy!
